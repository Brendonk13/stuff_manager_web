cleanup:
    - change action title to name everywhere
    - change context from required_cotnext to context
    - add created to action type ?
    - fix data shape for process items form
    - fix backend process items form -- doesnt probably work for existing projects
    - rename Action component to ActionList?

next:
    List Actions:
        - Figure out why filtering tags has so many renders and times the hook is called
        - maybe just make someday_maybe, delegated, etc always show up first for tags
        ------^^ do this for now, can change l8r
            - maybe have checkboxes for filtering by these 3
            -- this is probs way too confusing
            -- maybe too complicated, this should be figured out after the fact

            -- do I need the concept of lists ie someday_maybe list, food lists
            -- no but maybe I do need to have the concept of hierarchies
            -- maybe too complicated, this should be figured out after the fact

        # todo: be able to search by regex in descriptions for list actions

    list actions BUG:
        - calls get /actions with no query filter AFTER calling with

    actions details:
        -- need to transform someday_maybe to Someday Maybe -- maybe leave for now

    list actions:
        -- completed actions, unless filtered out, are shown with a darker background paper color

    - maybe add copy buttons next to titles when processing an action

    need to add a trash for actions

    Current:
        - Finish the favorites page
        - settings page after release
        - make sidebar have justifycontent: space-between

        - test get unprocessed with ID
        - need the processitem page to mark unprocessed things as processed OR just delete them maybe

    maybe redirect the user when they successfully complete the process item form


    SideBar
        - view all major lists


cool idea:
    - make it so that the request query params for list actions are appended to the current frontend as query strings
    - then we can save searches and have a feature for saved queries

        - Add controlled autocompletes for everything: tags etc
        add check marks to each filter so can disable each individually
        - and master check to disable all
        - finish components/Action.tsx
        - need? to add a cluttered mode where I can see lots of diff things at once without having to go to diff page
            - can toggle this per action AS WELL AS having a button to do it to all actions on the page

    - change Pagelayout to LoggedInLayout

    - change list actions to have wider Paper's when using mobile

    - have list views for different things
        - list projects:
            - be able to view actions from here


Autocomplete:
    - fix the clear button not being centered vertically
        https://mui.com/material-ui/api/autocomplete/#Autocomplete-prop-clearIcon
    - need to make sure it highlights/bolds your characters you type
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48444803/react-material-ui-autocomplete-highlight-searched-text-in-results
    - be able to pick multiple tags


Actionable form todo:
    FIX:
        - when you create a new thing, it autofills the form with the values from the previous form

    Energy slider:
        - see what it looks like to change the color as you slide: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/slider-with-colors-material-ui-io4q7?file=%2Fdemo.js
        - make it stand out less
        - make the size of the circle thing smaller so things look left-aligned (currently only looks aligned once you move the slider from 0)
        - make this look optional on the form ?



todo:
    - when goto link /unprocessed/100 ==> if 100 d.n exist or this user doesn't own it then we need to redirect the user to home
    - simplify types by always returning ID



Big features:
    - Notes system
    - calendar -- this could be such a bitch to work with datetimes this much
    - Post-complete-action form
        -- maybe implement this first with db then migrate to using git files ??
    - auto-delegate: sends a message through configured medium (ie email, slack)



Random features:
    - group items by contexts during sorting
    -- in additon to other methods
        - can have a "break" mode where you seperate things arbitrarily by space and blur idk
        - I wanted to group my todo list by context first then dates: today and tommorow and later themes
