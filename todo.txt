next:
    - have list views for different things
        - list projects:
            - be able to view actions from here

    - add hook for createActionable
    - fix types and form so that projects work with ID's
        -- rn works with strings
        -- need to edit the types/Action file s.t project is an object, instead of project_title the string

    - works on postman
    - then add hook for creating a processed item
    - and api
    processitempage:
        - already getting data from the hook
        - autofill the title and description
        - the data is in default values but not in the title or description
        - and can no longer edit said title

        solution:
            title, description are un-editable
            todo: how to make it clear what this title/description is for
            - add project picker so you can add the actions to existing projects or make a new one

Autocomplete:
    - fix the clear button not being centered vertically
        https://mui.com/material-ui/api/autocomplete/#Autocomplete-prop-clearIcon
    - need to make sure it highlights/bolds your characters you type
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48444803/react-material-ui-autocomplete-highlight-searched-text-in-results


Actionable form todo:
    FIX:
        - when you create a new thing, it autofills the form with the values from the previous form

    Energy slider:
        - see what it looks like to change the color as you slide: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/slider-with-colors-material-ui-io4q7?file=%2Fdemo.js
        - make it stand out less
        - make the size of the circle thing smaller so things look left-aligned (currently only looks aligned once you move the slider from 0)
        - make this look optional on the form ?



todo:
    - when goto link /unprocessed/100 ==> if 100 d.n exist or this user doesn't own it then we need to redirect the user to home
    - simplify types by always returning ID



Big features:
    - Notes system
    - calendar -- this could be such a bitch to work with datetimes this much
    - Post-complete-action form
        -- maybe implement this first with db then migrate to using git files ??
    - auto-delegate: sends a message through configured medium (ie email, slack)



Random features:
    - group items by contexts during sorting
    -- in additon to other methods
        - can have a "break" mode where you seperate things arbitrarily by space and blur idk
        - I wanted to group my todo list by context first then dates: today and tommorow and later themes
